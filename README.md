# Galton Board with Golang

This is a Galton Board simulation written in Golang. The Galton Board is a device that demonstrates the central limit theorem. It consists of a board with pegs arranged in a triangular pattern. Balls are dropped from the top and bounce off the pegs until they reach the bottom. The balls are collected in bins at the bottom, and the distribution of balls in the bins approximates a normal distribution.

The idea behind this project is to create a simulation of the Galton Board and find differents distributions that can be obtained by changing the pegs' positions.

## Pegs Distribution

Peg distributions:
- **Uniform:**
  - 0: Uniform

- **Horizontal Distribution:**
  - 1: Logarithmic
  - 2: Gaussian
  - 3: Inverse Gaussian
  - 4: Sinusoidal

- **Vertical Distribution:**
  - 5: Logarithmic
  - 6: Gaussian
  - 7: Inverse Gaussian
  - 8: Sinusoidal
